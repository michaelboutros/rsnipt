rsnipt
- Michael Boutros (me@michaelboutros)

-- Introduction
"Snipt is your collection of frequently used commands or code snippets." The aim of this library is to provide
an easy to use interface for developers to create new applications that can use Snipt. At the same time, a CLI
is provided in order to provide extremely easy access to the library's funtionality. Run 'snipt --help' for more information on that.

-- Progress
At present, almost all / all functionality of the website is implemented. I say all because it does everything that I would need, but I say almost all because someone else might come along and want something new. If you do want something new, feel free to do it yourself, or send me an email.

-- Contribution
I'm eagerly awaiting any pull requests, and unless your code causes pain to small kittens, it will most likely be accepted.

-- Usage and Tests
For usage examples, just browse the source until the full docs are written. As for tests, I haven't found any way of testing libraries that scrape websites. If anyone has any suggestions, feel free to put them forth.
