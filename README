rSnipt
- Michael Boutros (me@michaelboutros)

-- Introduction
"Snipt is your collection of frequently used commands or code snippets." The aim of this library is to provide
an easy to use interface for developers to create new applications that can use Snipt. For example, imagine this:

$ ./script/generate model User username:string password:string admin:boolean
$ snipt !! -d 'generate generic user model' -t 'ruby, rails, model' -p false

I know many developers live in their terminal, so this could be extremely useful. Also:

$ snipt -d 'generate generic user model'

Which would then execute the command that was created, whether from the website or from this library.

-- Progress
At present, you can completely manipulate a user's snipts (add/edit/delete), as well get public snipts. Next on the list is retrieving by tag, etc. until almost all of the website's functionality is available through the API.

-- Contribution
Just request a pull, and there is a 99% chance I'll take it, as long as it doesn't break anything.

-- Usage and Tests
For usage examples, just browse the source. As for tests, I've found that testing scraping libraries is flaky at best, so the only testing I've done is just verifying data. If someone would like to write a full test suite for the library, then please, feel free to do so.
