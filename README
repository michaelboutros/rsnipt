rSnipt
- Michael Boutros (me@michaelboutros)

-- Introduction
"Snipt is your collection of frequently used commands or code snippets." The aim of this library is to provide
an easy to use interface for developers to create new applications that can use Snipt. For example, imagine this:

$ ./script/generate model User username:string password:string admin:boolean
$ snipt !! -d 'generate generic user model' -t 'ruby, rails, model' -p false

I know many developers live in their terminal, so this could be extremely useful. Also:

$ snipt -d 'generate generic user model'

Which would then execute the command that was created, whether from the website or from this library.

-- Progress
At present, the code is stuck at updating / saving records. This is because it appears that when you POST to /save, the site checks your HTTP refferer, and if it isn't the user's index page it doesn't work. However, the developers of Snipt are not opposed to an API, and progress is being made in order to get it working.

-- Contribution
Just request a pull, and there is a 99% chance I'll take it, as long as it doesn't break anything.

-- Usage and Tests
For usage examples, just browse the source. As for tests, I've found that testing scraping libraries is flaky at best, so the only testing I've done is just verifying data. If someone would like to write a full test suite for the library, then please, feel free to do so.
